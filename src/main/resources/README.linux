# libnetcdf is packaged with this jna library.

# It is a statically linked shared object library, that should work on different systems.  To create it I ran these commands:

workdir=/home/me/netcdf-jna-working

# from netcdf source (4.1.3)
./configure --with-pic --disable-shared --prefix=${workdir}
make && make install

# from hdf5 source (1.8.7)
./configure --with-pic --disable-shared --prefix=${workdir}
make && make install

cd ${workdir}/lib
mkdir objs
cd objs
ar -x ../libhdf5.a
ar -x ../libhdf5_hl.a
ar -x ../libnetcdf.a
# also need the libc_nonshared because I was getting atexit issues
ar -x /usr/lib/libc_nonshared.a
# elf-init.oS was causing issues, so I just removed it (and fingers crossed it isn't needed)
rm elf-init.oS
ld -shared -static -o libnetcdf.so *.o *.oS -L/usr/lib/libc.a

# So this is what it took to build the library on my amd64 machine
# The same process (with differences specific to platform) should be done for anything we 
# want to support (i686, MacOS, Windows)

# Good luck
